    <string name="help_string">Use touchscreen and drag and drop to place game card on the corresponding column. Also you can just using touches on the columns and physical keyboard 1, 2, 3, 4 keys.\n\nThe object is to use all the cards by making combinations of 21 on any of the 4 column. If you succeed, you WIN the next level. The deck is NOT standard: suits are replaced by Snooders.\n\nEasy level is 32 cards. Medium level is 45 cards. Both Hard and Evil levels are 58 cards. The deck on each level includes 6 wild cards. A WILD card can be placed on any column for an automatic 21. If 5 cards on one column total less than 21, you are awarded the 21. An ACE is worth 1 or 11. J, Q, K are all worth 10.\n\nWhen a 21 is made, the column is cleared and can be used to build another 21. If a column total is greater then 21, the column is frozen. You MUST play a card until the deck is used, OR all columns are frozen, OR time runs out.\n\nThe value of making a 21 is worth more from left to right (100-400 points).\n\nYou also get additional 50 points for each card placed in a column. When out of cards, you get 200 bonus points for every card on the screen.\n\nThe game ends when time runs out (there are 3 and less minutes) or all 4 columns are frozen. In the fourth Evil level, you win the game when all the deck cards are used.</string>
